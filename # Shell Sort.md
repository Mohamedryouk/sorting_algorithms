 # Shell Sort

## Overview
Shell sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It is a generalization of the insertion sort algorithm, where the elements are sorted by progressively reducing the gap between the compared elements. The algorithm was invented by Donald Shell in 1959.

## Implementation Details
The provided C code implements the shell sort algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

### 1. Function Signature:
```c
void shell_sort(int *array, size_t length)
```
- The `shell_sort` function takes two parameters:
  - `array`: A pointer to the array of integers to be sorted.
  - `length`: The size of the array.

### 2. Variables:
```c
int outer, inner, insertion_value;
size_t gap = 1;
```
- `outer`: Loop variable used to iterate through the array.
- `inner`: Loop variable used to compare elements and shift them during insertion.
- `insertion_value`: Stores the value of the element being inserted.
- `gap`: The gap between the elements being compared. Initially set to 1.

### 3. Calculating the Initial Gap:
```c
while( gap < length / 3)
{
    gap = gap * 3 + 1;
}
```
- This loop calculates the initial gap using the formula `gap = 3 * gap + 1`. It continues until the gap is greater than or equal to one-third of the array length.

### 4. Sorting Loop:
```c
while(gap > 0)
{
    for (outer = gap; outer < length; outer++)
    {
        insertion_value = array[outer];
        inner = outer;
```
- The outer loop iterates through the array with the current gap.
- For each `outer` element, the `insertion_value` is set to the value of the current element.
- `inner` is initialized to the current `outer` index.

### 5. Insertion Sort:
```c
while(inner >= gap && array[inner - gap] > insertion_value)
{
    array[inner] = array[inner - gap];
    inner -= gap;
}
```
- This inner loop performs insertion sort within the
